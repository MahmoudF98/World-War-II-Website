World War II, also called Second World War, conflict that
involved virtually every part of the world during the years
1939–45. The principal belligerents were the Axis powers—
Germany, Italy, and Japan—and the Allies—France, Great 
Britain,the United States, the Soviet Union, and, to a 
lesser extent, China. The war was in many respects a 
continuation, after anuneasy 20-year hiatus, of the disputes
left unsettled by World War I.The 40,000,000–50,000,000
deaths incurred in World War II make it the bloodiest 
conflict, as well as the largest war, in history. Along with
World War I, World War II was one of the great watersheds
of 20th-century geopolitical history. It resulted in the 
extension of the Soviet Union’s power to nations of eastern
Europe, enabled a communist movement to eventually achieve 
power in China, and marked the decisive shift of power in
the world away from the states of western Europe and toward
the United States and the Soviet Union.

			<pre>
By the early part of 1939 the German dictator Adolf Hitler had become determined to
invade and occupy Poland. Poland, for its part, had guarantees of French and British
military support should it be attacked by Germany. Hitler intended to invade Poland 
anyway, but first he had to neutralize the possibility that the Soviet Union would 
resist the invasion of its western neighbour. Secret negotiations led on August 23–24 
to the signing of the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact in Moscow. In a secret protocol
of this pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed that Poland should be divided between
them, with the western third of the country going to Germany and the eastern two-thirds
being taken over by the U.S.S.R. Having achieved this cynical agreement, the other 
provisions of which stupefied Europe even without divulgence of the secret protocol, 
Hitler thought that Germany could attack Poland with no danger of Soviet or British 
intervention and gave orders for the invasion to start on August 26. News of the signing, 
on August 25, of a formal treaty of mutual assistance between Great Britain and Poland
(to supersede a previous though temporary agreement) caused him to postpone the start 
of hostilities for a few days. He was still determined, however, to ignore the diplomatic 
efforts of the western powers to restrain him. Finally, at 12:40 PM on August 31, 1939,
Hitler ordered hostilities against Poland to start at 4:45 the next morning. The invasion
began as ordered.<br><br>
<span id="begin">In response, Great Britain and France declared war on Germany on September 3, at 11:00 AM and at 5:00 PM,
respectively. World War II had begun.</span>
