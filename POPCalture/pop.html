            World War II In Popular Culture :
        </h2>
        
        <pre>
        There is a wide range of ways in which people have represented World War II in popular culture.
        Many works were created during the years of conflict and many more have arisen from that period of world history.
        Some well-known examples of books about the war, like Nobel laureate Kenzaburō Ōe's Okinawa Notes, could only have been 
        crafted in retrospect.

        <pre>
        During World War II, the relations between art and war can be articulated around two main issues.
        First, art (and, more generally, culture) found itself at the centre of an ideological war.
        Second, during World War II, many artists found themselves in the most difficult conditions (in an occupied country,
        in internment camps, in death camps) and their works are a testimony to a powerful “urge to create.” Such creative impulse can 
        be interpreted as the expression of self-preservation, a survival instinct in critical times.

        Social historians regard the works of popular culture from the World War II era as documents that mirror and define crucial 
        issues and concerns during that time. Individual combatants and those on the home fronts during World War II experienced the 
        war through newspaper reports, radio broadcasts, films, stage plays, books and popular music—all become noteworthy aspects of
        understanding the period and its impact on what happened afterward.
        World War II has provided material for many films, television programmes and books, beginning during the war. The film aspect
        had reached its peak by the 1960s, with films such as The Longest Day (which had been adapted from a book), The Great Escape,
        Patton and Battle of Britain. In the UK the actor Sir John Mills became particularly associated with war dramas, such as The
        Colditz Story (1954), Above Us the Waves (1955) and Ice Cold in Alex (1958), and was seen as the personification of Britain at
        war, conveying heroism and humility.

        Through the history of video and PC gaming, nearly every battle, skirmish, and secret operation that took place during 
        World War II has been recreated in a video game one way or another. While some World War II games try to stay true to the
        historical facts and records, others have taken some liberties and adjusted history to fit into new, fantastic storylines that 
        feature everything from the paranormal to aliens and even zombies.
