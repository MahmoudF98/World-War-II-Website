        Germany had been de facto divided, and two independent states, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic
        Republic were created within the borders of Allied and Soviet occupation zones, accordingly. The rest of Europe was also 
        divided into Western and Soviet spheres of influence. Most eastern and central European countries fell into the Soviet 
        sphere, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation 
        authorities. As a result, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Albania became Soviet 
        satellite states. Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy, causing tension with the USSR.

        Post-war division of the world was formalised by two international military alliances, the United States-led NATO and the 
        Soviet-led Warsaw Pact the long period of political tensions and military competition between them, the Cold War, would
        be accompanied by an unprecedented arms race and proxy wars.
        
        In Asia, the United States led the occupation of Japan and administrated Japan's former islands in the Western Pacific, while 
        the Soviets annexed Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. Korea, formerly under Japanese rule, was divided and occupied by the 
        Soviet Union in the North and the US in the South between 1945 and 1948. Separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th 
        parallel in 1948, each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of Korea, which led ultimately to the Korean War.

            Estimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary, because many deaths went unrecorded. Most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war including about
            20 million military personnel and 40 million civilians. Many of the civilians died because of deliberate genocide, massacres, mass-bombings, disease, and starvation.
            The Soviet Union lost around 27 million people during the war, including 8.7 million military and 19 million civilian deaths.
            The largest portion of military dead were 5.7 million ethnic Russians, followed by 1.3 million ethnic Ukrainians. A quarter of the people in the Soviet Union were
            wounded or killed. Germany sustained 5.3 million military losses, mostly on the Eastern Front and during the final battles in Germany.
            
            Of the total number of deaths in World War II, approximately 85 per cent—mostly Soviet and Chinese—were on the Allied sideand 15 per cent were on the Axis side.
            Many of these deaths were caused by war crimes committed by German and Japanese forces in occupied territories.
            An estimated 11 to 17 million civilians died either as a direct or asan indirect result of Nazi racist policies, including the Holocaust of around 6 million Jews,
            half of whom were Polish citizens,along with a further minimum 1.9 million ethnic Poles. Millions of other Slavs (including Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians),
            Roma, homosexuals, and other ethnic and minority groups were also killed. Hundreds of thousands (varying estimates) of ethnic Serbs, along with gypsies and Jews,
            were murdered by the Axis-aligned Croatian Ustaše in Yugoslavia, and retribution-related killings were committed just after the war ended.

            The German government led by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party was responsible for the Holocaust, the killing of approximately 6 million Jews, as well as 2.7 million ethnic Poles,
            and 4 million others who were deemed "unworthy of life" (including the disabled and mentally ill, Soviet prisoners of war, homosexuals, Freemasons, Jehovah's Witnesses,
            and Romani) as part of a programme of deliberate extermination.
            About 12 million, most of whom were Eastern Europeans, were employed in the German war economy as forced labourers.
            In addition to Nazi concentration camps, the Soviet gulags (labour camps) led to the death of citizens of occupied countries such as Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, 
            as well as German prisoners of war (POWs) and even Soviet citizens who had been or were thought to be supporters of the Nazis.
            Sixty per cent of Soviet POWs of the Germans died during the war. Richard Overy gives the number of 5.7 million Soviet POWs. Of those, 57 per cent died or were 
            killed, a total of 3.6 million. Soviet ex-POWs and repatriated civilians were treated with great suspicion as potential Nazi collaborators,
            and some of them were sent to the Gulag upon being checked by the NKVD.

                <pre>
            Europe, occupation came under two forms. In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low 
            Countries, and the annexed portions of Czechoslovakia) Germany established economic policies through which it collected 
            roughly 69.5 billion reichmarks (27.8 billion US dollars) by the end of the war, this figure does not include the sizeable 
            plunder of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods.[367] Thus, the income from occupied
            nations was over 40 per cent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 per cent of total
            German income as the war went on.
            
            In the East, the intended gains of Lebensraum were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and Soviet scorched earth 
            policies denied resources to the German invaders. Unlike in the West, the Nazi racial policy encouraged extreme 
            brutality against what it considered to be the "inferior people" of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus 
            followed by mass executions. Although resistance groups formed in most occupied territories, they did not 
            significantly hamper German operations in either the East or the West until late 1943.

            In Asia, Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, essentially a Japanese hegemony which it claimed was
            for purposes of liberating colonised peoples. Although Japanese forces were originally welcomed as liberators from European domination in some territories, 
            their excessive brutality turned local public opinion against them within weeks.
            During Japan's initial conquest it captured 4,000,000 barrels (640,000 m3) of oil (~5.5×105 tonnes) left behind by retreating Allied forces, and by 1943
            was able to get production in the Dutch East Indies up to 50 million barrels (~6.8×106 t), 76 per cent of its 1940 output rate.

                In Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics.
                In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and British Dominions) had a 30 per cent larger population 
                and a 30 per cent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis powers (Germany and Italy); if colonies are 
                included, it then gives the Allies more than a 5:1 advantage in population and nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP. In 
                Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan, but only an 89 per cent higher GDP; this 
                is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 per cent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.

                The United States provided about two-thirds of all the ordnance used by the Allies in terms of warships, transports, 
                warplanes, artillery, tanks, trucks, and ammunition. Though the Allies' economic and population advantages were 
                largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 
                1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies, as the war largely settled into one of attrition.
                While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed to the Allies having more access to 
                natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the labour force,
                Allied strategic bombing, and Germany's late shift to a war economy contributed significantly. Additionally, 
                neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and were not equipped to do so. To improve their 
                production, Germany and Japan used millions of slave labourers Germany used about 12 million people, mostly from 
                Eastern Europe, while Japan used more than 18 million people in Far East Asia.

                Aircraft were used for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and ground-support, and each role was advanced considerably.
                Innovation included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, 
                and personnel) and of strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the 
                enemy's ability to wage war). Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-
                to-air artillery, such as the German 88 mm gun. The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and, though late 
                introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.

                Advances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines. 
                Although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war, actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor,
                and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship.
                
                In the Atlantic, escort carriers proved to be a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection 
                radius and helping to close the Mid-Atlantic gap.[389] Carriers were also more economical than battleships because of 
                the relatively low cost of aircraft and their not requiring to be as heavily armoured. Submarines, which had 
                proved to be an effective weapon during the First World War, were anticipated by all sides to be important in the 
                second. The British focused development on anti-submarine weaponry and tactics, such as sonar and convoys, while 
                Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the Type VII submarine and wolfpack 
                tactics. Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the Leigh light, hedgehog, squid, and homing torpedoes
                proved victorious.

                Land warfare changed from the static front lines of World War I to increased mobility and combined arms. The tank, which had been used 
                predominantly for infantry support in the First World War,had evolved into the primary weapon.
                In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I, and advances continued throughout
                the war with increases in speed, armour and firepower.
                At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications. 
                This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding 
                tank-versus-tank combat. 
                This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across 
                Poland and France.
                Many means of destroying tanks, including indirect artillery, anti-tank guns (both towed and self-propelled), mines, short-ranged infantry antitank 
                weapons, and other tanks were used. Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces, and throughout the war, 
                most infantry were equipped similarly to World War I.
