		Many historians today believe that some of the causes of World War II can be traced to World War I (1914-1918). 
	Americans had fought in that earlier war to "Make the world safe for Democracy." Those were the words and goals
	of President Woodrow Wilson (President from 1913 to 1921). However, the peace treaties that ended World War I 
	seemed only to create in many people and governments, bitterness and anger that eventually boiled over and helped
	instill the inevitable beginnings of World War II.

	Germany and its allies had been defeated in World War I. Germany was ordered to hand over one sixth of its territory
	and forced to pay huge reparations (payments by a defeated country for the destruction it caused in a war).After World
	War I, Germany suffered from high unemployment and uncontrollable inflation which made the German money become 
	almost worthless. A "League of Nations" was set up after World War I to help try to keep the peace, however, the United
	States did not join, and other countries were too busy with their own problems to concern themselves with Germany and other 
	trouble spots. As the 1930s came about, the world was hit by an economic depression. Workers all over the world lost their 
	jobs, world trade fell off, and times were extremely hard all around. The citizens of the world were looking for leaders that
	could bring them the change they so desperately wanted and needed.

	After the end of World War I, Germany saw the rise of Adolf Hitler and his concept of Nazism (National Socialism, later
	converted to the National Socialist German Workers Party, NSDAP) both of which became quite popular in 1930s. Nazism 
	was a form of Socialism, and totally different from Marxism, which was typically characterized by racism and expansionism.
	National Socialism calls for obedience to a strong leader, so Adolf Hitler portrayed himself as that strong leader. While Germany
	witnessed the rise of Adolf Hitler and Nazism, Italy witnessed the rise of Benito Mussolini and Fascism. Fascism is formed by 
	violence, racism and totalitarianism. Both of these concepts are quite similar to each other and this portrayed Hitler and Mussolini
	as the leaders of the war against the Allied Powers.

	In the 1930s, the United States found itself largely concerned with the domestic economic troubles of the Great Depression,
	even as international crises loomed in Europe and Asia. Benito Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, had begun waging a war in
	Ethiopia using chemical weapons, such as mustard gas, and slaughtering thousands of innocent people. A violent and brutal
	civil war raged in Spain, staging General Francisco Franco's fascists against a variegated alliance of Communists and Democrats.
	Josef Stalin had risen to absolute power in Russia after imprisoning and executing several of his political enemies. Downtrodden
	Germans had rallied around Adolf Hitler, their new hero and leader, who called for Aryan deliverance after Germany's humiliation
	in World War I and launched an aggressive campaign to "unify" the German race throughout Europe. Meanwhile, in the East, Japan 
	had invaded Manchuria and was threatening to conquer China because they were, at the time, virtually unchecked by Western powers,
	who were preoccupied with problems closer to home.

	Through the troubled years of the late 1930s, Americans did everything they possibly could to avoid being drawn into these 
	growing conflicts abroad. In the end, staying out of World War II proved impossible; by the middle of 1941, President Roosevelt
	had committed American ships to an undeclared naval war with Germany in the North Atlantic, and on 7 December 1941 any
	question of America's further neutrality in the conflict ended with the mortifying surprise attack by the Japanese against
	the American naval station at Pearl Harbor.

					<pre>
			The Second Italo–Abyssinian War was a brief colonial war that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936. The war began with the
		invasion of the Ethiopian Empire (also known as Abyssinia) by the armed forces of the Kingdom of Italy (Regno d'Italia), which was 
		launched from Italian Somaliland and Eritrea.The war resulted in the military occupation of Ethiopia and its annexation into the newly
		created colony of Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana, or AOI); in addition it exposed the weakness of the League of Nations
		as a force to preserve peace. Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, but the League did nothing when the former clearly violated
		the League's Article X.Germany was the only major European nation to openly support the invasion. Italy subsequently dropped its
		objections to Germany's goal of absorbing Austria.

					<pre>
		When civil war broke out in Spain, Hitler and Mussolini lent military support to the Nationalist rebels, led by General
	Francisco Franco. The Soviet Union supported the existing government, the Spanish Republic. Over 30,000 foreign volunteers,
	known as the International Brigades, also fought against the Nationalists. Both Germany and the USSR used this proxy war as
	an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics. The Nationalists won the civil war in April 1939;
	Franco, now dictator, remained officially neutral during World War II but generally favoured the Axis.His greatest
	collaboration with Germany was the sending of volunteers to fight on the Eastern Front.

					<h3 class="titles">Japanese invasion of China (1937):</h3>
					<pre>
			In July 1937, Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of Peking after instigating the Marco 
		Polo Bridge Incident, which culminated in the Japanese campaign to invade all of China. The Soviets
		quickly signed a non-aggression pact with China to lend materiel support, effectively ending China's
		prior co-operation with Germany. From September to November, the Japanese attacked Taiyuan, as well as
		engaging the Kuomintang Army around Xinkou and Communist forces in Pingxingguan.Generalissimo Chiang
		Kai-shek deployed his best army to defend Shanghai, but, after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell.
		The Japanese continued to push the Chinese forces back, capturing the capital Nanking in December 1937.
		After the fall of Nanking, tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and
		disarmed combatants were murdered by the Japanese.

			In March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces won their first major victory at Taierzhuang but then the city
		of Xuzhou was taken by Japanese in May.In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by
		flooding the Yellow River; this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at
		Wuhan, but the city was taken by October.Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of
		Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve; instead the Chinese government relocated inland to
		Chongqing and continued the war.

					<h3 class="titles">Soviet–Japanese border conflicts:</h3>
					<pre>
			In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese forces in Manchukuo had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union and the
		Mongolian People's Republic. The Japanese doctrine of Hokushin-ron, which emphasised Japan's expansion northward,
		was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. With the Japanese defeat at Khalkin Gol in 1939, the ongoing
		Second Sino-Japanese War and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets, this policy would prove
		difficult to maintain. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a Neutrality Pact in April 1941, and Japan
		adopted the doctrine of Nanshin-ron, promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward, eventually leading to its
		war with the United States and the Western Allies.

					<h3 class="titles">European occupations and agreements:</h3>
					<pre>
			In Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive. In March 1938, Germany annexed Austria,
		again provoking little response from other European powers. Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German
		claims on the Sudetenland, an area of Czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic German population; and
		soon Britain and France followed the counsel of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and conceded
		this territory to Germany in the Munich Agreement, which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak
		government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands. Soon afterwards, Germany and
		Italy forced Czechoslovakia to cede additional territory to Hungary and Poland annexed Czechoslovakia's
		Zaolzie region.

			Although all of Germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement, privately Hitler was furious that
		British interference had prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation. In subsequent speeches
		Hitler attacked British and Jewish "war-mongers" and in January 1939 secretly ordered a major build-up of the German
		navy to challenge British naval supremacy. In March 1939, Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia and
		subsequently split it into the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and a pro-German client state, the Slovak
		Republic. Hitler also delivered the 20 March 1939 ultimatum to Lithuania, forcing the concession of the Klaipėda
		Region.

			Greatly alarmed and with Hitler making further demands on the Free City of Danzig, Britain and France guaranteed their
		support for Polish independence; when Italy conquered Albania in April 1939, the same guarantee was extended to Romania
		and Greece. Shortly after the Franco-British pledge to Poland, Germany and Italy formalised their own alliance with
		the Pact of Steel. Hitler accused Britain and Poland of trying to "encircle" Germany and renounced the Anglo-German
		Naval Agreement and the German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact.

			In August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact,a non-aggression treaty with a secret
		protocol. The parties gave each other rights to "spheres of influence" (western Poland and Lithuania for Germany;
		eastern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Bessarabia for the USSR). It also raised the question of continuing Polish
		independence. The agreement was crucial to Hitler because it assured that Germany would not have to face the prospect
		of a two-front war, as it had in World War I, after it defeated Poland.

			The situation reached a general crisis in late August as German troops continued to mobilise against the Polish border.
		In a private meeting with the Italian foreign minister, Count Ciano, Hitler asserted that Poland was a "doubtful neutral"
		that needed to either yield to his demands or be "liquidated" to prevent it from drawing off German troops in the future
		"unavoidable" war with the Western democracies. He did not believe Britain or France would intervene in the conflict. On
		23 August Hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 August, but upon hearing that Britain had concluded a formal mutual
		assistance pact with Poland and that Italy would maintain neutrality, he decided to delay it.

			In response to British requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, Germany made demands on Poland, which only served
		as a pretext to worsen relations. On 29 August, Hitler demanded that a Polish plenipotentiary immediately travel to
		Berlin to negotiate the handover of Danzig, and to allow a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor in which the German
		minority would vote on secession. The Poles refused to comply with the German demands and on the night of 30–31 August
		in a violent meeting with the British ambassador Neville Henderson, Ribbentrop declared that Germany considered its
		claims rejected.
