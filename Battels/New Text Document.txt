    <h3 class="headers">War breaks out in Europe (1939-40)</h3>
    On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland under the false pretext that the Poles had carried out
    series of sabotage operations against German targets near the border. Two days later, on 3 September, after 
    a British ultimatum to Germany to cease military operations was ignored, Britain and France, followed by the
    fully independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth-Australia (3 September), Canada (10 September)
    New Zealand (3 September), and South Africa (6 September)—declared war on Germany. However, initially the
    alliance provided limited direct military support to Poland, consisting of a cautious, half-hearted French
    probeinto the Saarland.The Western Allies also began a naval blockade of Germany, which aimed to damage
    thecountry's economy and war effort. Germany responded by ordering U-boat warfare against Allied merchantand
    warships, which was to later escalate into the Battle of the Atlantic.<br></br>
    On 17 September 1939, after signing a cease-fire with Japan, the Soviets invaded Poland from the east.The
    Polish army was defeated and Warsaw surrendered to the Germans on 27 September with final pockets of resistance
    surrendering on 6 October. Poland's territory was divided between Germany and the Soviet Union, with Lithuania
    and Slovakia also receiving small shares. After the defeat of Poland's armed forces, the Polish resistance
    establishedan Underground State and a partisan Home Army.About 100,000 Polish military personnel were
    evacuated to Romaniaand the Baltic countries; many of these soldiers later fought against the Germans in other
    theatres of the war.Poland's Enigma codebreakers were also evacuated to France. <br></br>
On 6 October, Hitler made a public peace overture to Britain and France, but said that the future of Poland was
    to be determined exclusively by Germany and the Soviet Union. Chamberlain rejected this on 12 October, saying
    "Past experience has shown that no reliance can be placed upon the promises of the present German
    Government."After this rejection Hitler ordered an immediate offensive against France,but bad weather
    forced repeated postponements until the spring of 1940.<br></br>
    After signing the German–Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation, the Soviet Union forced the
    Baltic countries—Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania—to allow it to station Soviet troops in their countries under
    pacts of "mutual assistance".Finland rejected territorial demands, prompting a Soviet invasion in
    November 1939.The resulting Winter War ended in March 1940 with Finnish concessions.Britain and
    France, treating the Soviet attack on Finland as tantamount to its entering the war on the side of the Germans,
    responded to the Soviet invasion by supporting the USSR's expulsion from the League of Nations.<br></br>
In June 1940, the Soviet Union forcibly annexed Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and the disputed Romanian
    regions of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and Hertza. Meanwhile, Nazi-Soviet political rapprochement and
    economic co-operation gradually stalled,and both states began preparations for
    war.

   	In April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway to protect shipments of iron ore from Sweden, which the 
   	Allies were attempting to cut off by unilaterally mining neutral Norwegian waters.Denmark capitulated 
   	after a few hours, and despite Allied support, during which the important harbour of Narvik temporarily was 
   	recaptured from the Germans, Norway was conquered within two months.British discontent over the Norwegian 
    campaign led to the replacement of the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, with Winston Churchill on
   	10 May 1940.<br></br>
 Germany launched an offensive against France and, adhering to the Manstein Plan also attacked the neutral 
    nations
    of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg on 10 May 1940.That same day British forces landed in Iceland 
    and the Faroes to preempt a possible German invasion of the islands.The U.S., in close co-operation with 
    the 
    Danish envoy to Washington D.C., agreed to protect Greenland, laying the political framework for the formal 
    establishment of bases in April 1941. The Netherlands and Belgium were overrun using blitzkrieg tactics in a 
    few days and weeks, respectively.The French-fortified Maginot Line and the main body of the Allied forces 
    which had moved into Belgium were circumvented by a flanking movement through the thickly wooded Ardennes 
    region,
    mistakenly perceived by Allied planners as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles.
    As a result, the bulk of the Allied armies found themselves trapped in an encirclement and were beaten. The 
    majority 
   were taken prisoner, whilst over 300,000, mostly British and French, were evacuated from the continent at 
   Dunkirk 
    by early June, although abandoning almost all of their equipment.<br></br>
 On 10 June, Italy invaded France, declaring war on both France and the United Kingdom.Paris fell to the 
    Germans on 14 June and eight days later France signed an armistice with Germany and was soon divided into 
    German and Italian occupation zones,and an unoccupied rump state under the Vichy Regime, which, though 
    officially neutral, was generally aligned with Germany. France kept its fleet but the British feared the 
    Germans would seize it, so on 3 July, the British attacked it.<br></br>

    The Battle of Britain began in early July with Luftwaffe attacks on shipping and harbours.On 19 July, 
    Hitler again publicly offered to end the war, saying he had no desire to destroy the British Empire. The United 
    Kingdom rejected this ultimatum.The main German air superiority campaign started in August but failed to 
    defeat RAF Fighter Command, and a proposed invasion was postponed indefinitely on 17 September. The German 
    strategic bombing offensive intensified as night attacks on London and other cities in the Blitz, but largely 
    failed to disrupt the British war effort.<br></br>

	Using newly captured French ports, the German Navy enjoyed success against an over-extended Royal Navy, using 
	U-boats against British shipping in the Atlantic.The British scored a significant victory on 27 May 1941 
	by sinking the German battleship Bismarck.Perhaps most importantly, during the Battle of Britain the 
	Royal Air Force had successfully resisted the Luftwaffe's assault, and the German bombing campaign largely 
	ended in May 1941.<br></br>

    Throughout this period, the neutral United States took measures to assist China and the Western Allies. In 
    November 1939, the American Neutrality Act was amended to allow "cash and carry" purchases by the Allies.I1940, 
    following the German capture of Paris, the size of the United States Navy was significantly increased. In 
    September, the United States further agreed to a trade of American destroyers for British bases.Still, a 
    large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention into the conflict 
    well into 1941.<br></br>
    Although Roosevelt had promised to keep the United States out of the war, he nevertheless took concrete steps 
    to prepare for war. In December 1940 he accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out negotiations as 
    useless, calling for the US to become an "arsenal of democracy" and promoted the passage of Lend-Lease aid to 
    support the British war effort.In January 1941 secret high level staff talks with the British began for 
    the purposes of determining how to defeat Germany should the US enter the war. They decided on a number of 
    offensive policies, including an air offensive, the "early elimination" of Italy, raids, support of resistance 
    groups, and the capture of positions to launch an offensive against Germany.<br></br>

    At the end of September 1940, the Tripartite Pact united Japan, Italy and Germany to formalise the Axis Powers. 
    The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any country, with the exception of the Soviet Union, not in the war which 
    attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three.The Axis expanded in November 1940 when 
    Hungary) to the Axis war against the USSR, partially to recapture territory ceded to the USSR, partially to 
    pursue its leader Ion Antonescu's desire to combat communism.<br></br>

   		Italy began operations in the Mediterranean, initiating a siege of Malta in June, conquering British 
   		Somaliland in August, and making an incursion into British-held Egypt in September 1940. In October 1940, 
   		Italy started the Greco-Italian War because of Mussolini's jealousy of Hitler's success but within days was 
   		repulsed with few territorial gains and a stalemate soon occurred.The United Kingdom responded to 
   		Greek requests for assistance by sending troops to Crete and providing air support to Greece. Hitler 
   		decided that when the weather improved he would take action against Greece to assist the Italians and 
   		prevent the British from gaining a foothold in the Balkans, to strike against the British naval dominance 
   		of the Mediterranean, and to secure his hold on Romanian oil.<br></br>

        In December 1940, British Commonwealth forces began counter-offensives against Italian forces in Egypt and 
        Italian East Africa.The offensive in North Africa was highly successful and by early February 1941 
        Italy had lost control of eastern Libya and large numbers of Italian troops had been taken prisoner. The 
        Italian Navy also suffered significant defeats, with the Royal Navy putting three Italian battleships out 
        of commission by a carrier attack at Taranto, and neutralising several more warships at the Battle of Cape 
        Matapan.<br></br>

    		The Germans soon intervened to assist Italy. Hitler sent German forces to Libya in February, and by the 
    		end of March the Axis had launched an offensive which drove back the Commonwealth forces which had been 
    		weakened to support Greece.In under a month, Commonwealth forces were pushed back into Egypt with 
    		the exception of the besieged port of Tobruk that fell later.The Commonwealth attempted to 
    		dislodge Axis forces in May and again in June, but failed on both occasions.<br></br>

            By late March 1941, following Bulgaria's signing of the Tripartite Pact, the Germans were in position 
            to intervene in Greece. Plans were changed, however, because of developments in neighbouring 
            Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav government had signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March, only to be overthrown 
            two days later by a British-encouraged coup. Hitler viewed the new regime as hostile and immediately 
            decided to eliminate it. On 6 April Germany simultaneously invaded both Yugoslavia and Greece, making 
            rapid progress and forcing both nations to surrender within the month. The British were driven from the 
            Balkans after Germany conquered the Greek island of Crete by the end of May.Although the Axis 
            victory was swift, bitter partisan warfare subsequently broke out against the Axis occupation of 
            Yugoslavia, which continued until the end of the war.<br></br>

           The Allies did have some successes during this time. In the Middle East, Commonwealth forces first 
           quashed an uprising in Iraq which had been supported by German aircraft from bases within 
           Vichy-controlled Syria,then, with the assistance of the Free French, invaded Syria and Lebanon to 
           prevent further such occurrences.<br></br>

      With the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made 
      preparations. With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese planning to take 
      advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in Southeast Asia, the two powers 
      signed the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941.By contrast, the Germans were steadily making 
      preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.<br></br>

      Hitler believed that Britain's refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the United States and the 
      Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later.He therefore decided to try to strengthen 
      Germany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that, to attack and eliminate them as a factor. In November 
      1940, negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets 
      showed some interest,but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany 
      considered unacceptable.On 18 December 1940,Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the 
      Soviet Union. <br></br>
       <img src="D:\school-will be deleted after finals-\Sublime Text 3\btls\9.jpg" align="left" height="270" width="400" border="1" hspace="5" >

       On 22 June 1941, Germany, supported by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, 
       with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting against them. They were joined shortly by Finland and 
       Hungary.The primary targets of this surprise offensivewere the Baltic region, 
       Moscow and Ukraine, with the ultimate goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line, 
       from the Caspian to the White Seas. Hitler's objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military 
       power, exterminate Communism, generate Lebensraum ("living space")by dispossessing the native 
       populationand guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's 
       remaining rivals.<br></br>

       Although the Red Army was preparing for strategic counter-offensives before the war,
       Barbarossa forced the Soviet supreme command to adopt a strategic defence. During the summer, the Axis made 
       significant gains into Soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel. By the 
       middle of August, however, the German Army High Command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably 
       depleted Army Group Centre, and to divert the 2nd Panzer Group to reinforce troops advancing towards central 
       Ukraine and Leningrad.The Kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in 
       encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies, and made possible further advance into Crimea and 
       industrially developed Eastern Ukraine (the First Battle of Kharkov).<br></br>

<tr><td>The diversion of three quarters of the Axis troops and the majority of their air forces from France and the 
	central Mediterranean to the Eastern Front prompted Britain to reconsider its grand strategy.
	In July, the UK and the Soviet Union formed a military alliance against Germany The British and 
	Soviets invaded neutral Iran to secure the Persian Corridor and Iran's oil fields.In August, the United 
	Kingdom and the United States jointly issued the Atlantic Charter.<br></br>

By October Axis operational objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region were achieved, with only the sieges of 
Leningrad and Sevastopol continuing. A major offensive against Moscow was renewed; after two 
months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, 
where the exhausted troopswere forced to suspend their offensive.Large territorial gains were made by 
Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet hands, 
the Soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military 
potential. The blitzkrieg phase of the war in Europe had ended.<br></br>

By early December, freshly mobilised reservesallowed the Soviets to achieve numerical parity 
with Axis troops.This, as well as intelligence data which established that a minimal number of Soviet troops 
in the East would be sufficient to deter any attack by the Japanese Kwantung Army,allowed the 
Soviets to begin a massive counter-offensive that started on 5 December all along the front and pushed German 
troops 100-250 kilometres (62-155 mi) west.<br></br></td>

		In 1939, the United States had renounced its trade treaty with Japan; and, beginning with an aviation 
		gasoline ban in July 1940, Japan became subject to increasing economic pressure.During this time, Japan 
		launched its first attack against Changsha, a strategically important Chinese city, but was repulsed by 
		late September.Despite several offensives by both sides, the war between China and Japan was stalemated by 
		1940. To increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces in 
		the event of a war with the Western powers, Japan invaded and occupied northern Indochina.Afterwards, the 
		United States embargoed iron, steel and mechanical parts against Japan.Other sanctions soon followed.

        Chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in early 1940. In August, Chinese 
        communists launched an offensive in Central China; in retaliation, Japan instituted harsh measures in 
        occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists.Continued antipathy between 
        Chinese communist and nationalist forces culminated in armed clashes in January 1941, effectively ending 
        their co-operation.In March, the Japanese 11th army attacked the headquarters of the Chinese 19th army but 
        was repulsed during Battle of Shanggao.In September, Japan attempted to take the city of Changsha again and
        clashed with Chinese nationalist forces. <br></br></td>

	 German successes in Europe encouraged Japan to increase pressure on European governments in Southeast Asia. 
	 The Dutch government agreed to provide Japan some oil supplies from the Dutch East Indies, but negotiations 
	 for additional access to their resources ended in failure in June 1941.In July 1941 Japan sent troops to 
	 southern Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East. The United States, United 
	 Kingdom and other Western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on Japanese assets and a total oil 
	 embargo.At the same time, Japan was planning an invasion of the Soviet Far East, intending to 
	 capitalize off the German invasion in the west, but abandoned the operation after the sanctions.<br></br>

     Since early 1941 the United States and Japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their 
     strained relations and end the war in China. During these negotiations Japan advanced a number of proposals 
     which were dismissed by the Americans as inadequate.At the same time the US, Britain, and the 
     Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories, in the event of a 
     Japanese attack against any of them.Roosevelt reinforced the Philippines (an American protectorate 
     scheduled for independence in 1946) and warned Japan that the US would react to Japanese attacks against any 
     "neighboring countries".<br></br>
     Frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the American-British-Dutch sanctions, Japan 
     prepared for war. On 20 November a new government under Hideki Tojo presented an interim proposal as its final 
     offer. It called for the end of American aid to China and for the supply of oil and other resources to Japan. 
     In exchange Japan promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw its forces from 
     southern Indochina.The American counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of 
     China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific powers.That meant Japan was 
     essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in China, or seizing the natural resources it 
     needed in the Dutch East Indies by force;the Japanese military did not consider the former an option, 
     and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war. <br></br>

			Japan planned to rapidly seize European colonies in Asia to create a large defensive 
		perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific; the Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of 
		Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war.To prevent 
		American intervention while securing the perimeter it was further planned to neutralise the United States
		Pacific Fleet and the American military presence in the Philippines from the outset.On 7 December 
		1941 (8 December in Asian time zones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous 
		offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific.These included an attack on the American 
		fleet at Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, landings in Thailand and Malaya and the battle of Hong Kong.
        <br></br> <br></br>
        These attacks led the United States, United Kingdom, China, Australia and several other states to formally

        European Axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan.Germany, followed by the

		On 1 January 1942, the Allied Big Four-the Soviet Union, China, Britain and the United States-and 22 
		smaller or exiled governments issued the Declaration by United Nations, thereby affirming the Atlantic 
		Charter,and agreeing to not to sign a separate peace with the Axis powers.<br></br>

        During 1942, Allied officials debated on the appropriate grand strategy to pursue. All agreed that 
        defeating Germany was the primary objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack 
        on Germany through France. The Soviets were also demanding a second front. The British, on the other hand, 
        argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to 
        increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. Germany itself would be subject to a heavy 
        bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without 
        using large-scale armies.Eventually, the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was 
        infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa.<br></br>

        At the Casablanca Conference in early 1943, the Allies reiterated the statements issued in the 1942 
        Declaration by the United Nations, and demanded the unconditional surrender of their enemies. The British 
        and Americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to fully 
        secure the Mediterranean supply routes.Although the British argued for further operations in the 
        Balkans to bring Turkey into the war, in May 1943, the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit 
    Allied operations in the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland and to invade France in 1944.<br></br></td>

    	By the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally Thailand had almost fully conquered Burma, Malaya, the Dutch 
    	East Indies, Singapore, and Rabaul, inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of 
    	prisoners.Despite stubborn resistance by Filipino and US forces, the Philippine Commonwealth was 
    	eventually captured in May 1942, forcing its government into exile.On 16 April, in Burma, 7,000 
    	British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the Battle of Yenangyaung and rescued 
    	by the Chinese 38th Division.Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the South China Sea, 
    	Java Sea and Indian Ocean,and bombed the Allied naval base at Darwin, Australia. In January 1942, the 
    	only Allied success against Japan was a Chinese victory at Changsha.These easy victories over 
    	unprepared US and European opponents left Japan overconfident, as well as overextended.<br></br>

        In early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to capture Port Moresby by amphibious assault and thus sever 
        communications and supply lines between the United States and Australia. The planned invasion was thwarted 
        when an Allied task force, centred on two American fleet carriers, fought Japanese naval forces to a draw 
        in the Battle of the Coral Sea.Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier Doolittle Raid, was to 
        seize Midway Atoll and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would 
        also send forces to occupy the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.In mid-May, Japan started the 
        Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign in China, with the goal of inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided the 
        surviving American airmen in the Doolittle Raid by destroying air bases and fighting against the Chinese 
        23rd and 32nd Army Groups.In early June, Japan put its operations into action but the Americans, 
        having broken Japanese naval codes in late May, were fully aware of plans and order of battle, and used 
        this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at Midway over the Imperial Japanese Navy.<br></br></td>

   With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle, Japan chose to 
   focus on a belated attempt to capture Port Moresby by an overland campaign in the Territory of Papua.The 
   Americans planned a counter-attack against Japanese positions in the southern Solomon Islands, primarily 
   Guadalcanal, as a first step towards capturing Rabaul, the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia.<br></br>

   Both plans started in July, but by mid-September, the Battle for Guadalcanal took priority for the Japanese, and 
   troops in New Guinea were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the northern part of the island, 
   where they faced Australian and United States troops in the Battle of Buna-Gona.Guadalcanal soon became a 
   focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal.
   <br></br>
   By the start of 1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops.In Burma, Commonwealth 
   forces mounted two operations. The first, an offensive into the Arakan region in late 1942, went disastrously, 
   forcing a retreat back to India by May 1943.The second was the insertion of irregular forces behind 
   Japanese front-lines in February which, by the end of April, had achieved mixed results.<br></br>

Despite considerable losses, in early 1942 Germany and its allies stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and 
southern Russia, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year.In May the Germans 
defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch Peninsula and at Kharkov,and then launched their main summer offensive 
against southern Russia in June 1942, to seize the oil fields of the Caucasus and occupy Kuban steppe, while
maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front.

The Germans split Army Group South into two
groups: Army Group A advanced to the lower Don River and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while Army Group B 
headed towards the Volga River. The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad on the Volga.<br></br>
By mid-November, the Germans had nearly taken Stalingrad in bitter street fighting when the Soviets began their 
second winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingradand an assault on the 
Rzhev salient near Moscow, though the latter failed disastrously.By early February 1943, the German Army had taken 
tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been forced to surrender,and the front-line had been pushed back 
beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the 
Germans launched another attack on Kharkov, creating a salient in their front line around the Soviet city of Kursk.</td></tr>

	Exploiting poor American naval command decisions, the German navy ravaged Allied shipping off the American 
	Atlantic coast.By November 1941, Commonwealth forces had launched a counter-offensive, Operation 
	Crusader, in North Africa, and reclaimed all the gains the Germans and Italians had made.In North Africa, 
	the Germans launched an offensive in January, pushing the British back to positions at the Gazala Line by early 
	February,followed by a temporary lull in combat which Germany used to prepare for their upcoming 
	offensives.Concerns the Japanese might use bases in Vichy-held Madagascar caused the British to invade 
	the island in early May 1942.An Axis offensive in Libya forced an Allied retreat deep inside Egypt until 
	Axis forces were stopped at El Alamein.On the Continent, raids of Allied commandos on strategic targets, 
	culminating in the disastrous Dieppe Raid,demonstrated the Western Allies' inability to launch an 
	invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation, equipment, and operational security.
<br></br>
    In August 1942, the Allies succeeded in repelling a second attack against El Alamein and, at a high cost, 
    managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged Malta.A few months later, the Allies 
    commenced an attack of their own in Egypt, dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across 
    Libya.This attack was followed up shortly after by Anglo-American landings in French North Africa, which 
    resulted in the region joining the Allies.Hitler responded to the French colony's defection by ordering 
    the occupation of Vichy France;although Vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they 
    managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by German forces.The now pincered Axis forces 
    in Africa withdrew into Tunisia, which was conquered by the Allies in May 1943.

    <br></br>
    In early 1943 the British and Americans began the Combined Bomber Offensive, a strategic bombing campaign 
    against Germany. The goals were to disrupt the German war economy, reduce German morale, and "de-house" the 
civilian population.<br></br></td>

	After the Guadalcanal Campaign, the Allies initiated several operations against Japan in the Pacific. In May 
	1943, Canadian and U.S. forces were sent to eliminate Japanese forces from the Aleutians.Soon after, the U.S., 
	with support from Australian and New Zealand forces, began major operations to isolate Rabaul by capturing 
	surrounding islands, and breach the Japanese Central Pacific perimeter at the Gilbert and Marshall Islands.By 
	the end of March 1944, the Allies had completed both of these objectives, and had also neutralised the major 
	Japanese base at Truk in the Caroline Islands.<br></br>
	In April, the Allies launched an operation to retake Western New 
	Guinea.In the Soviet Union, both the Germans and the Soviets spent the spring and early summer of 1943 
	preparing for large offensives in central Russia. On 4 July 1943, Germany attacked Soviet forces around the 
	Kursk Bulge. Within a week, German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets' deeply echeloned and 
	well-constructed defencesand, for the first time in the war, Hitler cancelled the operation before it had 
	achieved tactical or operational success.This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies' invasion 
	of Sicily launched on 9 July which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest 
	of Mussolini later that month.Also, in July 1943 the British firebombed Hamburg killing over 40,000 people.<br></br>

    On 12 July 1943, the Soviets launched their own counter-offensives, thereby dispelling any chance of German 
    victory or even stalemate in the east. The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority,giving 
    the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front.The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along 
    the hastily fortified Panther–Wotan line, but the Soviets broke through it at Smolensk and by the Lower Dnieper 
    Offensives.
<br></br>
    On 3 September 1943, the Western Allies invaded the Italian mainland, following Italy's armistice with the 
    Allies.Germany with the help of fascists responded by disarming Italian forces that were in many places without 
    superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas,and creating a series of defensive lines.German 
    special forces then rescued Mussolini, who then soon established a new client state in German-occupied Italy 
    named the Italian Social Republic,causing an Italian civil war. The Western Allies fought through several lines 
    until reaching the main German defensive line in mid-November.<br></br>

    German operations in the Atlantic also suffered. By May 1943, as Allied counter-measures became increasingly 
    effective, the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval 
    campaign.In November 1943, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met with Chiang Kai-shek in Cairo and 
    then with Joseph Stalin in Tehran.The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese territory 
    and the military planning for the Burma Campaign,while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies 
    would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months of 
    Germany's defeat.<br></br>
    From November 1943, during the seven-week Battle of Changde, the Chinese forced Japan to fight a costly war of 
    attrition, while awaiting Allied relief.In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of 
    attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio.By the 
    end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region,ending the 
    longest and most lethal siege in history.

    The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided 
    by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in 
    the Baltic Sea region.By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from 
    Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops.The Allied offensives in 
    Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was 
    captured.
<br></br>
    The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, 
    an operation against British positions in Assam, India,and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and 
    Kohima.In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma,and 
    Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina.The second 
    Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held 
    territory and capture Allied airfields.By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of Henan and begun a 
    new attack on Changsha in the Hunan province.<br></br>

	On 6 June 1944 (known as D-Day), after three years of Soviet pressure,the Western Allies invaded northern 
	France. After reassigning several Allied divisions from Italy, they also attacked southern France.These 
	landings were successful, and led to the defeat of the German Army units in France. Paris was liberated by the 
	local resistance assisted by the Free French Forces, both led by General Charles de Gaulle, on 25 August and 
	the Western Allies continued to push back German forces in western Europe during the latter part of the year. 
	An attempt to advance into northern Germany spearheaded by a major airborne operation in the Netherlands 
	failed.After that, the Western Allies slowly pushed into Germany, but failed to cross the Ruhr river in a large 
	offensive. In Italy, Allied advance also slowed due to the last major German defensive line.
    <br></br>
    On 22 June, the Soviets launched a strategic offensive in Belarus ("Operation Bagration") that destroyed the 
    German Army Group Centre almost completely.Soon after that another Soviet strategic offensive forced German 
    troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland.<br></br>
    The Soviet advance prompted resistance forces in Poland to 
    initiate several uprisings against the German occupation. However, the largest of these in Warsaw, where German 
    soldiers massacred 200,000 civilians, and a national uprising in Slovakia, did not receive Soviet support and 
    were subsequently suppressed by the Germans.The Red Army's strategic offensive in eastern Romania cut off and 
    destroyed the considerable German troops there and triggered a successful coup d' etat in Romania and in 
    Bulgaria, followed by those countries' shift to the Allied side.<br></br>

	In September 1944, Soviet troops advanced into Yugoslavia and forced the rapid withdrawal of German Army Groups 
	E and F in Greece, Albania and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off.By this point, the Communist-led 
	Partisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the 
	occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against 
	German forces further south. In northern Serbia, the Red Army, with limited support from Bulgarian forces, 
	assisted the Partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of Belgrade on 20 October. A few days later, 
	the Soviets launched a massive assault against German-occupied Hungary that lasted until the fall of Budapest 
	in February 1945.Unlike impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans, bitter Finnish resistance to the Soviet 
	offensive in the Karelian Isthmus denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to a Soviet-Finnish 
	armistice on relatively mild conditions,although Finland was forced to fight their former allies.

    By the start of July 1944, Commonwealth forces in Southeast Asia had repelled the Japanese sieges in Assam, 
    pushing the Japanese back to the Chindwin River while the Chinese captured Myitkyina. In September 1944, 
    Chinese force captured the Mount Song to reopen the Burma Road.In China, the Japanese had more successes, 
    having finally captured Changsha in mid-June and the city of Hengyang by early August.[262] Soon after, they 
    invaded the province of Guangxi, winning major engagements against Chinese forces at Guilin and Liuzhou by the 
    end of November and successfully linking up their forces in China and Indochina by mid-December.
<br></br>
    In the Pacific, US forces continued to press back the Japanese perimeter. In mid-June 1944, they began their 
    offensive against the Mariana and Palau islands, and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the Battle of the 
    Philippine Sea. These defeats led to the resignation of the Japanese Prime Minister, Hideki Tojo, and provided 
    the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands. In late 
    October, American forces invaded the Filipino island of Leyte; soon after, Allied naval forces scored another 
    large victory in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, one of the largest naval battles in history.<br></br>

On 16 December 1944, Germany made a last attempt on the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to 
launch a massive counter-offensive in the Ardennes and along the French–German border to split the Western Allies, 
encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and capture their primary supply port at Antwerp to prompt a 
political settlement.By January, the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled.In Italy, 
the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line. In mid-January 1945, the Soviets and Poles 
attacked in Poland, pushing from the Vistula to the Oder river in Germany, and overran East Prussia.On 4 February, 
Soviet, British and US leaders met for the Yalta Conference. They agreed on the occupation of post-war Germany, and 
on when the Soviet Union would join the war against Japan.<br></br>

In February, the Soviets entered Silesia and Pomerania, while Western Allies entered western Germany and closed to 
the Rhine river. By March, the Western Allies crossed the Rhine north and south of the Ruhr, encircling the German 
Army Group B,while the Soviets advanced to Vienna. In early April, the Western Allies finally pushed forward in 
Italy and swept across western Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg, while Soviet and Polish forces stormed 
Berlin in late April. American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river on 25 April. On 30 April 1945, the Reichstag 
was captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany.<br></br>

Several changes in leadership occurred during this period. On 12 April, President Roosevelt died and was succeeded 
by Harry S. Truman. Benito Mussolini was killed by Italian partisans on 28 April.Two days later, Hitler committed 
suicide, and was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl Donitz.<br></br>

    In the Pacific theatre, American forces accompanied by the forces of the Philippine Commonwealth advanced in 
    the Philippines, clearing Leyte by the end of April 1945. They landed on Luzon in January 1945 and recaptured 
    Manila in March following a battle which reduced the city to ruins. Fighting continued on Luzon, Mindanao, and 
    other islands of the Philippines until the end of the war.Meanwhile, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) 
    were destroying strategic and populated cities and towns in Japan in an effort to destroy Japanese war industry 
    and civilian morale. On the night of 9-10 March, USAAF B-29 bombers struck Tokyo with thousands of incendiary 
    bombs, which killed 100,000 civilians and destroyed 16 square miles (41 km2) within a few hours. Over the next 
    five months, the USAAF firebombed a total of 67 Japanese cities, killing 393,000 civilians and destroying 65% 
    of built-up areas.<br></br>

    In May 1945, Australian troops landed in Borneo, overrunning the oilfields there. British, American, and 
    Chinese forces defeated the Japanese in northern Burma in March, and the British pushed on to reach Rangoon by 
    3 May. Chinese forces started to counterattack in Battle of West Hunan that occurred between 6 April and 7 June 
    1945. American naval and amphibious forces also moved towards Japan, taking Iwo Jima by March, and Okinawa by 
    the end of June.At the same time, American submarines cut off Japanese imports, drastically reducing Japan's 
    ability to supply its overseas forces.<br></br></td>

    	On 11 July, Allied leaders met in Potsdam, Germany. They confirmed earlier agreements about Germany,and 
    	reiterated the demand for unconditional surrender of all Japanese forces by Japan, specifically stating 
    	that "the alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction".During this conference, the United Kingdom 
    	held its general election, and Clement Attlee replaced Churchill as Prime Minister.
<br></br>
        The Allies called for unconditional Japanese surrender in the Potsdam Declaration of 27 July, but the 
        Japanese government rejected the call. In early August, the USAAF dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese 
        cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br></br>
        The Allies justified the atomic bombings as a military necessity to avoid 
        invading the Japanese home islands which would cost the lives of between 250,000 and 500,000 Allied 
        servicemen and millions of Japanese troops and civilians.Between the two bombings, the Soviets, pursuant to
        the Yalta agreement, invaded Japanese-held Manchuria, and quickly defeated the Kwantung Army, which was the 
        largest Japanese fighting force.The Red Army also captured Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands. On 15 
        August 1945, Japan surrendered, with the surrender documents finally signed at Tokyo Bay on the deck of the 
        American battleship USS Missouri on 2 September 1945, ending the war.</td>
